# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This application is a weather dashboard which uses the open weather API, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, and local storage techniques. The user can input a city into the search bar and receive a current forecast and 5 day forecast for that city. Cities the user has searched are stored in local storage and displayed on a sidebar for the user to easily access after refreshing the page for the first time. If a user clicks the cities in the sidebar the current and 5 day forecasts will easily populate. In addition icons are displayed for weather types and the UV index is color coded. 

****side bar history will only populate only initial refresh
